# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    I'm getting a lot better at getting into a focused state of productivity and staying engaged. I've been good about taking short breaks when I reach a good stopping point.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
