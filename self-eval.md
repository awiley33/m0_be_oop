# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    It felt exciting to be working on a solution with the toolkit I have so far. During the Hobbit problem, it was fun to try out possible solutions to try and solve it. I'm not sure if I got it correct but I felt I was getting close.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    I'm getting a lot better at getting into a focused state of productivity and staying engaged. I've been good about taking short breaks when I reach a good stopping point.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    I need to remember that I can use my logic skills and knowledge to try out new things even if I haven't explicitly learned them. Trial and error!
